Hi! 👋

My name is Ryan,

Professionally, I’m a software developer that specializes in enterprise software used in the utilities Industry.

However, this site isn’t about my professional life. You can go to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-arnold-zoleta-a62756119/) for more on that.

This site is about the things I do and make outside my work, particularly the various web and mobile apps which I have made during my spare time.

Regarding techology, I use React and React Native on the frontend and Python with the Flask web framework on the backend.

I also maintain a blog about a variety of topics that’s on my mind, mostly tech.
