Probably the most important decision a solo dev will make is choosing the tech stack they will work on for the rest of their life (because you know, nobody changes tech in the middle of their life).

When undertaking this humongous task, I think it's important to apply first principles thinking.

What are you really trying to accomplish here? Like, if you were to boil down all your dev efforts into once sentence, what would it be?

For me its "Ship apps regularly, and ship rapidly".

For others it might be "Be employable" or "Make the next Facebook".

The reason why first priciple thinking is so useful in this context is that choosing a stack involves a ton of micro decisions.

- What framework?
- Which linter?
- Which editor and which extensions?
- Which platform?

But if you have core principle in your work that you can go back to, then you would be surprised how easy it is to answer all these questions.

Whenever you have to make an important decision about the way you work, just go back to your first priciple.

### "What framework?"

If I go to my first principle of "Ship apps regularly, and ship rapidly", then I'll lean into more simple and barebones frameworks like Svelte for the frontend and Flask for the backend.

If my first principle was instead "Be employable", then my decision entirely depends on what specific skills are "in demand" at the moment. To answer that question, I might go to indeed.com and look at the top 5 technologies employers are looking for, and focus on that.
